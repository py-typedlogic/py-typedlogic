"""
Generators can be used to create universally quantified variables in a way
that preserves type safety.

Example:
-------
```python

TreeNodeType = str

class AncestorOf(BaseModel, Fact):
    ancestor: TreeNodeType
    descendant: TreeNodeType

@axiom
def ancestor_transitivity_axiom() -> bool:
    '''For all x,y,z, if AncestorOf(x,z) and AncestorOf(z,y), then AncestorOf(x,y)'''
    return all(
        AncestorOf(ancestor=x, descendant=y)
        for x, y, z in gen3(TreeNodeType, TreeNodeType, TreeNodeType)
        if AncestorOf(ancestor=x, descendant=z) and AncestorOf(ancestor=z, descendant=y)
    )
```

The above axiom defines a universally quantified statement over the variables x, y, and z, whose
range is all strings.

Note that while the semantics of the above program are consistent with Python semantics,
actually executing the above code would take infinite time as there are infinite strings.
Instead, the python is treated as a logical specification.
