# Typing in typed-logic

Broadly speaking, logics can be broken down into *untyped* logics, and *typed* (also known as *sorted* logics).

The data model for typedlogic follows the typed logic model

## Pytheories

Any typed-logic theory written in Python follows the same rules as the rest of Python.
It must of course be a valid Python program, without any syntax or runtime errors.

Additionally, you can avail yourself of standard Python tooling to help keep your code clean
and bug-free. This includes type checking, whether via a tool such as `mypy`, or simply
via your IDE.
